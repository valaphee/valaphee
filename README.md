# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here is a overview of all open source projects I did so far:

[protod](https://github.com/valaphee/protod) - Part of the conglomerate of synergy (but it's a build required tool): Protocol Buffers Decompiler extracts Protocol Buffers descriptors from any file.<br>
[synergy](https://github.com/valaphee/synergy) - A conglomerate, everything that is to small to fit in its on project ((transparent) proxies for bgs, http(s), mcbe; casc storage format, OpenCV-related stuff, drivers and Windows Hooks for virtual kbd and ms which also can be used to remote control PCs via drivers - "Physical" Input, etc.)

### Libraries
[foundry](https://github.com/valaphee/foundry) - A set of libraries for common used functionalities which are not included in Java or Kotlin.<br>
[jackson-dataformat-nbt](https://github.com/valaphee/jackson-dataformat-nbt) - Support for reading and writing NBT-encoded data via Jackson abstractions.<br>
